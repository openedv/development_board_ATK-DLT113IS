Please note: The product is available in two versions: eMMC and NAND. The accompanying development/auxiliary documentation is based on the eMMC version.

The NAND version has limited storage space and only retains the core hardware testing functions. Some software functions in the documentation are not supported.

Please confirm the required version before purchasing.
